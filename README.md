## About wochstack

## Tips In Development
- --> work with db (updating) --> schema.prisma: adding new models (table) -> we need to issue a migration (npx prisma migrate dev (lose data-continue- yes)+enter migration name)   ((WARNING) : old session is holding the old seed, so we need to clear the cookies/sessions in the browser (untill fixed in epicstack itself))


## !TODO:
- to use objects/arrays from db, - create new model that will store all the texts and they will be related by id to the page/module (same logic as notes being assigned in their own model to each user)...

- redesign User model (table) in db to match our criteria - no way to register, only admin/superadmin user can create other users with only sub-role permissions (superadmin -> only admin and lower..., admin -> only owner and lower, ...)
- start creating texts import (first create uploading file to db and transforming rows/columns into translations, then secondary depending on the output of the json from db of these translations - create shortcodes(aka. global translations variables/constants/functions))

- - !DONE:  create sitemap for admin's functions visualization
- - !DONE: setup the whole environment to be ready to work and develop own customizations to get ready for the actual real development
- - !DONE: dashboard/admin setup - built in function of (requireUserWithPermission/requireAdmin) to get to the /admin page, if not logged in, client(user) will be redirected to the login page
- !DONE: create and ux/ui admin environment
- !DONE:  handle 404 not found page for blind routes - https://remix.run/guides/not-found  (handled my epic-stack in error-boundary.tsx)
  - !DONE: make the error boundary main div container 100% height and style it + add header, etc


### !TODO:: /w Jenda
- !! look into Radix UI + prepare to tell Jenda to look into Radix + Tailwind to know if we can implement these straight into these apps - easier, stronger approach imho
- think about components, that I could start working on (f.e. calendars, bookings, connections to airbnb/booking..   /   other components that can be developed even without ux/ui)

### For Discussion:
- imports/texts/titles,etc. -> figure out the DB table scheme for "shortcuts" and mapping through the pages' texts that should be coming from the clients
