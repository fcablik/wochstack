## Tips In Development
- --> work with db (updating) --> schema.prisma: adding new models (table) -> we need to issue a migration (npx prisma migrate dev (lose data-continue- yes)+enter migration name)   ((WARNING) : old session is holding the old seed, so we need to clear the cookies/sessions in the browser (untill fixed in epicstack itself))


## !TODO:
- create sitemap for admin's functions visualization 
- redesign User model (table) in db to match our criteria - no way to register, only admin/superadmin user can create other users with only sub-role permissions (superadmin -> only admin and lower..., admin -> only owner and lower, ...)
- design admin environment

- - !DONE: setup the whole environment to be ready to work and develop own customizations to get ready for the actual real development
- - !DONE: dashboard/admin setup - built in function of (requireUserWithPermission/requireAdmin) to get to the /admin page, if not logged in, client(user) will be redirected to the login page


### For Discussion:
- imports/texts/titles,etc. -> figure out the DB table scheme for "shortcuts" and mapping through the pages' texts that should be coming from the clients
